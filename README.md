- 👋 Hi, I’m @BartoliniAndBorderCollies. I’m currently seeking a position as a `Java Developer`.
- 🔭 For the past six years, I have been part of an IT team responsible for the development of a commercial project called ‘Vincent Web API’. This application, designed for pricing windows and doors, is used by 90% of window companies in Norway and Sweden.
- 👀 I’ve developed a passion for programming and Computer Science, dedicating many hours each day to studying. I’ve been learning `Java since October 2022` under the guidance of a professional developer who serves as my teacher and mentor. I continue to learn Java by developing apps and receiving code reviews from my mentor.
- 🛠 Skills and technologies: `Java`, `JavaScript`, `XML`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Spring Boot`, `Hibernate`, `React`, `Spring Security`, `SQL`, `HQL`, `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `IntelliJ`, `Virtual Studio Code`, `Postman`, `Postbird`, `mySQL Workbench`, `Git`, `GitHub`, `GitLab`, `Jira`, `Scrum methodology`, `JUnit`, `Mockito`, `integration testing`.
<br>  Currently, I'm learning `React` and other frontend technologies. To achieve this, I take classes with my developer mentor and teacher, and I have also enrolled in the `Frontend Developer course` at [Code Me Foundation](https://codeme.pl/b2b-en)
